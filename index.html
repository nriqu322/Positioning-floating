        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
        with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and 
        equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should 
        have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe 
        bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have 
        infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the 
        universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
      </p>
      <p>
        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform 
        from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron 
        out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be 
        diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
      </p>
      <p>
        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double 
        box around it.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the 
        beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, 
        looked right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes 
        at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian 
        Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational 
        waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a 
        trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun 
        evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, 
        wondered whether it could ever be proved.
